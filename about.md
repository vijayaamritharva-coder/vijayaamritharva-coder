# About Me

Hello! I am **Vijaya Amritha R**, currently pursuing my **B.Com; LL.B (Hons.)** at the School of Law, SASTRA University (2022–2027). With a strong academic foundation and keen interest in law, I have complemented my studies with practical experience through internships, legal aid activities, and judicial clerkships.  

I am passionate about exploring diverse aspects of law—ranging from civil and criminal proceedings to contemporary social issues. My experiences at the Madras High Court and with various legal institutions have enhanced my **research, drafting, and analytical skills**.  

Beyond law, I express myself through **poetry, creative writing, and language learning**. I enjoy reading, ballet, and contributing to anthologies and literary projects. My academic and extracurricular journey reflects adaptability, teamwork, and creativity.
